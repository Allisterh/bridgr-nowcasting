Description: The bridgr package provides a comprehensive framework for working 
    with mixed-frequency time series data, empowering analysts to bridge the gap
    between high- and low-frequency indicators for nowcasting and 
    short-term forecasting. Designed with flexibility and integration in mind, 
    bridgr facilitates seamless application alongside popular R packages such 
    as forecast, while introducing advanced modeling capabilities tailored to 
    the unique challenges of mixed-frequency analysis.

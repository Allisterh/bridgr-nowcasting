`bridgr` is designed to simplify the implementation and evaluation of bridge models, which are useful for nowcasting (predicting the present or near-term) and forecasting macroeconomic variables like GDP. 

Bridge models are statistical tools that link high-frequency indicators (e.g., monthly industrial production) to low-frequency target variables (e.g., quarterly GDP) by forecasting and aggregating the indicators to match the target's frequency. They enable timely predictions before the official release of low-frequency data, making them essential for policymakers who need early insights for decision-making.

## Installation

From CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("bridgr")
```

You can install the development version of `bridgr` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcburri/bridgr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example:

```{r example}
library(bridgr)

gdp <- suppressMessages(tsbox::ts_pc(bridgr::gdp))

bridge_model <- bridge(
  target = gdp, 
  indic = baro, 
  indic_predict = "auto.arima", 
  indic_lags = 2, 
  target_lags=1, 
  h=2
)

forecast(bridge_model)

summary(bridge_model)
```

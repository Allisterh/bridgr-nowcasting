\arguments{
\item{target}{A time series or data frame representing the target variable (dependent variable).
It should be in a format compatible with the \code{tsbox} package.}

\item{indic}{A time series, list of time series, or data frame containing the indicator variables
(independent variables). It must be in a format compatible with the \code{tsbox} package.}

\item{indic_predict}{A character string or vector specifying the prediction method(s) for the
indicator variables. Defaults to \code{"mean"}. Future updates will add support for methods
from the \code{forecast} package.}

\item{indic_aggregate}{A character string or vector specifying the aggregation method(s)
for aligning indicator variables with the target variable. Defaults to \code{"mean"}. Future updates
will support custom weighting functions.}

\item{indic_lags}{An integer or vector of integers specifying the number of lags to include
for the indicator variables. Defaults to \code{0} (no lags).}

\item{target_lags}{An integer specifying the number of lags to include for the target variable.
Defaults to \code{0} (no lags).}

\item{h}{An integer specifying the forecast horizon (in terms of the target variable's frequency).
Defaults to \code{1} (next period).}

\item{frequency_conversions}{A named vector specifying the conversion factors for different
time frequencies (e.g., days per week, weeks per month). Defaults to \code{c("dpw" = 5, "wpm" = 4, "mpq" = 3, "qpy" = 4)}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the model, such as parameters for forecasting
methods from the \code{forecast} package (to be implemented in future versions).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bridge_model}, containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{target}: The standardized target variable.
\item \code{indic}: The standardized indicator variables.
\item \code{indic_predict}: The prediction methods applied to the indicators.
\item \code{indic_aggregate}: The aggregation methods used for indicators.
\item \code{final_forecasting_date}: The calculated end date for forecasting.
\item Additional internal parameters and summary statistics.
}
}
\description{
This function estimates a bridge model for nowcasting or forecasting purposes.
The bridge model aligns high-frequency indicator variables (\code{indic}) with a
lower-frequency target variable (\code{target}) and performs nowcasting or forecasting
based on user-specified parameters.
}
\details{
The bridge model aligns time series of different frequencies by slicing and aggregating
indicator variables to match the target variable's frequency. It uses predefined rules
for frequency conversion and alignment. The function checks for mismatches in start dates
and aligns the variables when necessary.

Future extensions will include:
\itemize{
\item Support for more sophisticated forecasting methods from the \code{forecast} package.
\item Custom weighting functions for indicator aggregation.
\item Enhanced validation and flexibility in specifying prediction and aggregation strategies.
}
